A simple Mvc and IdentityAPI exercise project.
Html and javascript codes may be missing or incorrect. 
Especially since I don't have enough javascript training yet, I usually proceed by adapting similar sample codes.
This project is my first training project that I created entirely using my Mvc, Entity Framework Core and Identity API trainings.
Please feel free to warn me and make suggestions for the parts you think are wrong.
